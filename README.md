# NodeJs Image Compression


Welcome to the Node.js TypeScript Image Compression project, where I explore the exciting world of image compression using Express.js. In this project, I'll guide you through the process of setting up a Node.js server for image compression.

## Project Overview

This project involves building an Express.js server that allows you to upload images and compress them. We'll use TypeScript for strong typing and better code quality. The server will run on port 3001 and will provide image compression functionality.

## Getting Started

To begin your journey with this project, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Navigate to your desired directory and use the following commands:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <project_directory>

2. **Install Dependencies:** Next, install the project dependencies using Yarn. This will ensure you have all the necessary packages to run the app:


   ```bash
   yarn install

**Running:**


   ```bash
   yarn dev

> This is running on PORT 3001
